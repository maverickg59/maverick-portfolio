# Portfolio

This is my portfolio site. It's bootstrapped with CRA because it's the simplest approach IMO. I've left much of the boiler plate the same. If the need arises I'll eject and run webpack.

It's currently a single page app with no back end. I plan to add fun projects over time. I'll build and deploy a back end when the need arises.

## CRA Resources

I've left some of the README intact as point of reference in case I need to dig for info.
